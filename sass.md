Hello world, SASS!!
=========

### Installing on Windows
First, you will have to install [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org).

Run "__Start Command Prompt with Ruby__" from Start Menu. Then run the below script.

```ruby
gem install sass
```

Done, now SASS is on your machine! So, let's play with it. Open your text editor. Create a file "test.scss" along with following contents:

```css
.red{
	color:red;
}
```
In your __Ruby CMD__,
```
$>sass test.scss
```
